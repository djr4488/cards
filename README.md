# Cards

## Purpose
To provide an implementation of a few simple card games, e.g. Pitch, Hearts, Spades, Golf, and so forth.

## History
It started out life in C#, wasn't terribly great but it worked, but why require the Windows to play a game?

## Goals - 
1. Use AngularJS to implement my front end and TomEE and JavaEE to implement the backend using restful services.
1a. Originally, I started out using Struts2, but then I thought there might be a better way to use REST APIs and separate the front and back end components.
1b. That is why I chose AngularJS and Bootstrap for the front end.
2. Implement my card game first.  While probably it will never be "popular" or anything like that, well my family likes to play it and they are in all parts of the U.S. and world for that matter.
3. Implement other card games that are more well known.
4. I'd like to convert the database side to use Cassandra in the future, but for the time being MySQL and EclipseLink are what it will be.
5. Making it open source so anybody can contribute to it, just doing this under the Apache licensing.
6. Making it available for folks to have something to see in regard to my coding style.

## Licensing
See /cards/wiki/Licensing for the Apache licensing I am choosing to release this under.
