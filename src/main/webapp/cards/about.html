            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am just a software developer who likes what he does and wanted to learn AngularJS, TomEE, REST APIs, and 'BigData' technologies.</p>
            <p>To do that I am taking a card game I made originally in C# for my networking class at K-State in 2006.  While the original goal was to convert it to Java using Struts2, the original code well it kinda sucked.  So this represents a complete re-write!</p>
            <p>I plan am using AngularJS for the front end, exposing REST APIs in the backend, and currently using MySQL for database(though I want to switch to Cassandra to learn it).</p>
            <p>The plan is to implement some card games -
            <ul>
                <li>Golf - I'll provide instructions to it later</li>
                <li>Follow that by Pitch, Spades, and/or Hearts</li>
                <li>Since this is open source, anybody can contribute and implement what they want.  Just note your own work please!</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
